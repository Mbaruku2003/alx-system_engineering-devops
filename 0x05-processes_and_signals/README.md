a process is an instance of execution of a program
every process has its own id which is always positive
for small computers the PID is 32768 however processes in cloud may require even more id
what limits a processs ID is its RAM
ps - a command that means process status
ps is used to display the current running process and so unlike top, its output is not in realtime
to get more information about a process use ps -u
ps -A is used to list all the processes


TOP
used to give information about processses in real time along with cpu usage and memory


SIGNALS
